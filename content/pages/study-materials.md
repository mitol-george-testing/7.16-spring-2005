Apoptosis in Mammalian Cells ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/projectlab2005))

Movie #1 ([MOV](/ans7870/7/7.16/s05/studymaterials/hela6.mov))  
This clip shows 4 HeLa cells that have been transfected with a CFP-DEVD-YFP reporter gene. They were then treated with TNF and imaged at 6-minute intervals. YFP fluorescence is pseudo-colored red, while CFP fluorescence is pseudo-colored green. In the two cells that die, note the shift in color from red to green (i.e., YFP to CFP) in the frame prior to cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing.

Movie #2 ([MOV](/ans7870/7/7.16/s05/studymaterials/devdimsrfpmovie1.mov))  
This clip shows 4 HeLa cells that have been transfected with a reporter gene in which RFP is fused to part of Smac. They were then treated with TNF and imaged at 6-minute intervals. RFP fluorescence is shown as a white signal on a black background. Note the sudden redistribution of RFP from the mitochondria (punctate/squiggly shapes) to the cytosol (diffuse staining throughout the cell).
